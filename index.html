			<div>				
				<p>WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is planning to issue a sweeping directive telling every public school district in the country to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity.</p>
				<p>A letter to school districts will go out Friday, adding to a highly charged debate over transgender rights in the middle of the administration’s legal fight with North Carolina over the issue. The declaration — signed by Justice and Education department officials — will describe what schools should do to ensure that none of their students are discriminated against.</p>
				<p>The move is certain to draw fresh criticism, particularly from Republicans, that the federal government is wading into local matters and imposing its own values on communities across the country that may not agree. It represents the latest example of the Obama administration using a combination of policies, lawsuits and public statements to change the civil rights landscape for gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people.</p>
				<p>After supporting the rights of gay people to marry, allowing them to serve openly in the military and prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against them, the administration is wading into the battle over bathrooms and siding with transgender people.</p>
				<p>“No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,” John B. King Jr., the secretary of the Department of Education, said in a statement. “We must ensure that our young people know that whoever they are or wherever they come from, they have the opportunity to get a great education in an environment free from discrimination, harassment and violence.”</p>

			<div>				
				<p>Shake Shack Inc ( SHAK ) stock is jumping in after-hours trading on Thursday after a first-quarter earnings report that left its haters stunned and silenced.</p>
				<p>SHAK stock earned 8 cents per share in the first quarter, double the 4 cents it earned in the year-ago period and meaningfully higher than the nickel per share analysts expected.</p>
				<p>More importantly, however, Shake Shack showed that its blistering revenue growth is more sustainable than people thought. Analysts expected revenue to jump 37.7% to $52.06 million in the first quarter; instead, revenue roared 43.3% higher to $54.2 million. That came on "Same-Shack" sales - the company's cheeky equivalent of same-store sales - that grew by nearly 10%.</p>
				<p>The real icing on the cake for SHAK stock owners, however, came in the form of the company's revised full-year 2016 guidance. Every meaningful metric was higher than the burger chain thought it would be just two months ago.</p>
				<p>The New York-based Shake Shack now expects full-year sales to come in between $245 million and $249 million, up from the guidance of between $237 million and $242 million that the company gave in March.</p>
				<p>Same-Shack sales also are expected to be meaningfully higher than previously anticipated. This, I think, is a very good sign because while location expansion is nice, SSS growth shows that the company is thinking about what's going on inside of its stores - an absolutely vital trait for restaurant stocks like Shake Shack.</p>
				<p>In my eyes, if Shake Shack was growing same-shack sales at 3% this year, SHAK stock would be justified to trade in the $20s.</p>
