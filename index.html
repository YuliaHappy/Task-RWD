			<div>				
				<p>WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is planning to issue a sweeping directive telling every public school district in the country to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity.</p>
				<p>A letter to school districts will go out Friday, adding to a highly charged debate over transgender rights in the middle of the administration’s legal fight with North Carolina over the issue. The declaration — signed by Justice and Education department officials — will describe what schools should do to ensure that none of their students are discriminated against.</p>
				<p>“No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,” John B. King Jr., the secretary of the Department of Education, said in a statement. “We must ensure that our young people know that whoever they are or wherever they come from.” — signed by Education department officials.</p>

			<div>				
				<p>Shake Shack Inc ( SHAK ) stock is jumping in after-hours trading on Thursday after a first-quarter earnings report that left its haters stunned and silenced.</p>
				<p>SHAK stock earned 8 cents per share in the first quarter, double the 4 cents it earned in the year-ago period and meaningfully higher than the nickel per share analysts expected.</p>
				<p>More importantly, however, Shake Shack showed that its blistering revenue growth is more sustainable than people thought. Analysts expected revenue to jump 37.7% to $52.06 million in the first quarter; instead, revenue roared 43.3% higher to $54.2 million. That came on "Same-Shack" sales - the company's cheeky equivalent of same-store sales - that grew by nearly 10%.</p>
				<p>In my eyes, if Shake Shack was growing same-shack sales at 3% this year, SHAK stock would be justified to trade in the $20s.</p>
